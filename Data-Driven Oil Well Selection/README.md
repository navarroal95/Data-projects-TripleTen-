Data-Driven Oil Well Selection: Profitability and Risk Assessment for OilyGiant
Introduction
This project analyzes geological data from three regions to determine the best location for OilyGiant's next oil well development. By leveraging a linear regression model, the project predicts oil reserve volumes and selects the top 200 wells in each region for profitability estimation. The analysis considers key business constraints, such as a $100 million budget and $4.5 thousand revenue per barrel, and uses bootstrapping to assess risk and minimize losses below a 2.5% threshold. Based on the findings, recommendations are made to identify the most profitable and least risky region for development.

Steps and Methodologies
1. Data Exploration and Cleaning
Objective: Check for missing values, duplicates, and provide an initial overview of the data.
Key Insights:
Data from three regions (Region 0, Region 1, Region 2) contains 100,000 entries each, with no missing values.
Duplicate IDs were identified and removed:
Region 0: 10 duplicates
Region 1: 4 duplicates
Region 2: 4 duplicates
2. Feature Analysis and Visualization
Visualizations:
Histograms: Show frequency distributions of features (f0, f1, f2, and product) for each region.
Box Plots: Highlight outliers and variability in feature values across regions.
Observations:
Region 2 features are more symmetrically distributed, indicating stability.
Regions 0 and 1 exhibit multimodal distributions and more pronounced outliers.
3. Linear Regression Modeling
Goal: Predict oil reserves based on three features (f0, f1, f2).
Process:
Data split into training (75%) and validation (25%) sets.
Features scaled using StandardScaler.
Linear regression model trained and evaluated using RMSE.
Key Results:
Region 0: RMSE = 37.76, Avg Reserves = 92.40 thousand barrels
Region 1: RMSE = 0.89, Avg Reserves = 68.71 thousand barrels
Region 2: RMSE = 40.15, Avg Reserves = 94.77 thousand barrels
4. Profit and Risk Assessment
Profit Calculation:
Top 200 wells with the highest reserves selected in each region.
Region 0 yielded the highest profit: $33.59M.
Bootstrapping:
Simulated profit distributions to assess risk of loss.
Region 1 has the lowest risk (1.5%), followed by Region 0 (6%) and Region 2 (8%).
Break-Even Analysis:
Break-even reserve volume: 111.11 thousand barrels.
All regions fall below this threshold on average.
Results
Profit Analysis:
Region 0: $33.59M
Region 1: $24.15M
Region 2: $25.99M
Risk of Loss:
Region 0: 6%
Region 1: 1.5%
Region 2: 8%
Recommendation: Region 1 is the best choice for oil well development, balancing moderate profit potential with the lowest risk.
Conclusion
The analysis concludes that Region 1 offers the best opportunity for oil well development due to its low risk (1.5%) and moderate profit potential ($24.15M). While none of the regions surpass the break-even threshold on average, Region 1â€™s stability and profitability make it the most viable option. Future work could focus on cost optimization and advanced predictive modeling to enhance profitability.
